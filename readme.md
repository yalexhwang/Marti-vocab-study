#Marti's Vocab Study

*I tutor Marti on a weekly basis to teach her Korean grammar, vocaburary and writing. Marti wants to take vocab quizzes as often as possible to stay on top of her Korean vocab game. So the webpage created to help her study. Currently there are two modes: review and quiz.* 

###>> Review Mode << 
In the form of a digital flash card, each Korean word that is available in the word bank will be presented. The flash card will have the Korean word, its definition or meaning in English, and which part of speech it is (verb, noun, adjective, adverb, etc.). Planning to add 'example' and 'difficulty level' feature to the card. 

###>> Quiz Mode <<
Korean words available in the word bank will be used to generate quiz questions. Currently only supporting multi-choice based quiz. 


#####>> Future features to come << 
**Update the word bank**: user will have access to the word bank, to add/edit/remove the words and its cotent. 

**Score board**: user's previous scores will be saved and presented in various way (graphs, etc.) in the score board, in order to see the progress.

**Dictionary API**: install a serach bar that utilizes a dictionary API, so user can use a dicrionary without having to leave the page. 
Additional features to Quiz Mode: Difficulty level (based on the frequency user gets the correct answer for the word), timed mode (set time limit to answer each question).
