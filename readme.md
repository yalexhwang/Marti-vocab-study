# Marti's Study Room

Marti's Study Room is an web application created for my friend, Marti, whom I teach Korean, to aid her vocaburary memorization. I used to send her emails with a quiz file attached and wanted to automate this process to save time. With the app, Marti can take a quiz whenver she wants, and I can track her progress. <i>Work in progress</i>

  - In the form of a digital flash card, each Korean word that is available in the word bank will be presented. The flash card will have the Korean word, its definition or meaning in English, and which part of speech it is (verb, noun, adjective, adverb, etc.). Planning to add 'example' and 'difficulty level' feature to the card.
